# Movie Recommendation System

## Background

Predicting the success of a movie before its release and understanding the factors that contribute to its success is a fascinating challenge. Whether it's the budget, cast, crew, or genre, there are numerous variables that can influence a movie's performance at the box office and its critical acclaim. This project aims to build a movie recommendation system that helps users discover movies they are likely to enjoy based on various features and attributes.

## Data Source Transfer Summary

We have utilized a dataset from The Movie Database (TMDb) as the primary data source for this movie recommendation system. This dataset contains a wealth of information about thousands of movies, including details about the plot, cast, crew, budget, and revenues. The dataset has been modified to provide more accurate and up-to-date information compared to the original version.

Key information about the dataset transfer:

- The dataset now includes full credits for both the cast and crew.
- Actor and actress names are listed in the order they appear in the credits.
- Revenues appear to be more current and accurate.
- Some movies from the original dataset that couldn't be ported were due to inaccuracies.

## Data Source Transfer Details

- Some fields in the dataset contain JSON data and functions for loading this data are available for convenience.
- Certain fields like "runtime" may not be consistent across versions, so caution is advised when using this information.
- Full credits for cast and crew are now stored in a separate file.

## Open Questions About the Data

While we have made efforts to improve the dataset, there are still some uncertainties and open questions:

- The currency of budgets and revenues is not confirmed. It's unclear whether they consistently represent global revenues in US dollars.
- The dataset hasn't undergone a comprehensive data quality analysis. Users are encouraged to identify and report any data discrepancies or corrections.
- Budgets with values of zero were treated as missing in the IMDb version. Similar issues might exist in this dataset.

## Inspiration

This movie recommendation system can be used to explore various questions and insights, including:

- Categorizing movies by type, such as animated or non-animated, based on crew job titles.
- Analyzing the divide between major film studios and independent productions.
- Clustering movies to discover natural groupings and patterns.

## Getting Started

To use this movie recommendation system, follow these steps:

1. **Data Acquisition**: Acquire the dataset from TMDb or an appropriate source and ensure it's in a format compatible with the system.

2. **Data Preprocessing**: Preprocess the data to handle missing values, convert data types, and perform any necessary cleaning and feature engineering.

3. **Building the Recommendation System**: Implement the recommendation system using machine learning algorithms or collaborative filtering techniques.

4. **User Interface**: Develop a user-friendly interface for users to interact with the recommendation system.

5. **Deployment**: Deploy the system on a web platform or as a standalone application.

6. **Testing and Evaluation**: Test the recommendation system's performance and gather user feedback for improvement.

7. **Continuous Improvement**: Continuously update and improve the system based on user feedback and changing data.
